# tab-tracker
This is a simple tool built with chrome extensions, python(django) and JavaScript (Reactjs) that helps you track the time spent on websites opened in your chrome browser.
## How to setup
### 1. Cline this repository and load the extensions folder as a chrome extension in your browser. 
### 2. Once you're done, visit this URL to track your time https://web-tracker-hhjh.intended.com.

# NOTE
#You may see websites that you have not visited because the tool is so far not personalised for each user. I plan on doing this by adding an user authentication so only websites of logged in users will be tracked.
